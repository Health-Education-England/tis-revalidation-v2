# Revalidation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.11.

## Pre requisite

- Clone this repo and then run `npm install` in order to get all dependencies.

## Development server

- Run `npm run start` for a dev server which will consume staging hosted BE endpoints. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
\*NOTE on build you may encounter `Error: Call retries were exceeded`
fix: `node --max_old_space_size=4096 node_modules/@angular/cli/bin/ng build`

## Coding Style

To ensure consistency across formatting of files, we use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Please ensure you setup your IDE using one of the following tutorials.

In case you haven't done this, there is also now a git-hook to ensure your code updates match the Prettier style:

- Webstorm: `https://prettier.io/docs/en/webstorm.html`
- VSCode: `https://github.com/prettier/prettier`
- Sublime: `https://github.com/danreeves/sublime-prettier`

When writing Cypress e2e tests, ensure you follow best practices (https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices). In particular when `cy.get()` you should target data-cy properties on elements rather than using more vague selectors (e.g. id, element name etc.).

## Git Hooks

[Local Git Hooks](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks) are managed and maintained using [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky).

There is currently one `pre-commit` active githook in the project which can be found within `package.json`. This git hook runs;

1.  **Prettier:** Ensures that the code follows the same style independant of developer. Prettier will restructure your code on every commit.
2.  **Linting:** Ensures typescript and scss code is linted by running the `ng lint` script. Any errors occurred during linting will prevent the commit from completing

## State Management

We are using [NGXS](https://www.ngxs.io/) for state management. The [NGXS cli](https://www.ngxs.io/plugins/cli) can be leveraged in order to auto generate files.

Example usage;

```
ngxs --name foo
```

Full options

```
--name name         Store name
--directory path    By default, the prompt is set to the current directory
--folder-name name  Use your own folder name, default: state
--spec boolean      Creates a spec file for store, default: true
```

## Running unit tests

Run `npm test` or `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Prequisite - set environment variables;

```
export CYPRESS_username=xxxxxxx
export CYPRESS_password=xxxxxxx
export CYPRESS_baseUrl=xxxxxxx
```

The [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) e2e tests can be run;

- In headless mode in the electron browser via `npm run cypress` or
- In interactive mode utilising the Cypress Test Runner via `npm run cypress:open` .
